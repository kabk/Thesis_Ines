			At this moment, I’m about to start the tedious deed of writing my bachelor graduation thesis. Before embarking on that jour­ney, the first question that comes to mind is whether or not speaking in the first person is appropriate or not. That question, in itself, interestingly enough, is completely embedded in this thesis’ subject matter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;	Thus far, it has proven to be a trying process to get through a graphic design education. Whether or not that has to do with the specific country, city or school is irrelevant at this point in time. To describe it in a nutshell, it all starts with a general ex­planation and introduction of what the fundaments of graphic design are, or could be, according to the individuals selected to teach the curriculum’s courses. A number of rules or conditions, if you will, are given to the students and the content itself can be gathered and created by the student. So for example, a theme is set but it’s boundaries are so large that you have as much free­dom as you’d like to ponder. Personally, I found this huge sea of possibilities quite intimidating, so as much and as often as possible, I attempted to set a system of confinements to work within. Strangely enough, I started noticing that those that strayed from the teacher’s criteria would be applauded while those that followed the rules were dryly encouraged to include more subjectivity into their work the next time around. Showing your character and your views is a plus point, which is empha­sized in the latter years of the study. The projects started to relate more to responsible –almost political– subjects. One example was to research and convey the effects the European Union has on its extremely diverse member countries. Another was to sift through the multitude of .pdf files that the Dutch Ministry of Finance compiles to set the annual budget.<br>
			<br>One could argue that giving this kind of dense information to students from all sorts of educational backgrounds could be quite the risk, yet still, the teaching staff was optimistic. From left and right complaints arose because of the complexity of the information, dragging people to the conclusion that there was no way they would ever be able to grasp any of it. My pro­cess was jolted at the first phase, as I noticed I had just been handed content that I could never decipher, and furthermore, probably wasn’t supposed to ever be able to decipher. This was an inte­resting thought. It brought me to my end result, which was a simple pamphlet that made a proposition to the Ministry of Finance to, from this year on, create an executive summary, for each person in the Netherlands. Why? Because they allege to be civil servants working for our collective benefit, but their mes­sage and estimates never reach the public directly. First they are tainted and manipulated by the media and news agencies. This is something that I believe is a great pity. To finally get to the point, once I showed the teachers my work, they said that I hadn’t put enough of my own opinions and beliefs into the work. Even though I did that entirely on purpose, my work was deemed lacking and insufficient because apparently when dealing with this kind of complex information, one cannot refrain from adding a subjective layer. My claim was that it is impossible for a graphic design student, for heaven’s sake, to suggest that they even begin to understand this material without a great deal of experience, skills and investment in the field. It was dismissed. Whether or not the subjective approach is of greater value than one wherein the designer’s opinions are absent will be discussed at a later point.
			<br>All of a sudden there was this burning yearning to be much more than just a designer. The following quote describes the exact situation we were being introduced to: 
<br><br><br><h4>
“…We are not just mediators of information, but individuals who think creatively and visually about our culture.” (Keedy)
</h4><br><br><br>

<h5>This statement was extracted from an article about the post­modernist approach in graphic design. The piece argues that due to the short life span of our work in comparison to other fields such as architecture, we feel the need to add a specific value, beyond the message we’re actually supposed to be communicating. Due to the ever-growing amount of visual infor­mation we’re constantly smothered with, in order to truly get through to the viewing audience, we need to bring complex issues down to a personal, relatable level. But then we might 
as well stop regarding the graphic design field as a field in the first place, if we’re constantly supposed to dive into unknown fields and specializations. Does this urge come from the fact that what was once our specialization, i.e. creating visual iden­tities, is now up for grabs for anyone with a computer and a Facebook account? Let’s take a moment to reflect on the discuss modernism and its relation to postmodernism. Of course, I feel it is of great impor­tance to state that the definition of each of these words could greatly vary depending on whom you’re having a conversation with. 
<br><br><br><h4>
“The withdrawal of the personality of the designer behind the idea, the themes, the enterprise, or the product is what the best minds are all striving to achieve”. (Müller-Brockmann)
</h4><br><br><br>
<h5>Is it possible to create products of visual communication whose sole purpose is to relay a message with as little personal bias as possible? In other words, to what extent can one argue that ob­jectivity can enhance how a message is received? This re­search attempts to convince the reader of many arguments, one of which is that the contradicting, omnipresent, subjective approach cannot remain unconsidered.	
	In order to decipher the meaning of objectivity within the realm of visual communication, a number of established metho­dologies will be cross-examined throughout the duration of this essay. Additionally, individuals operating in the field of graphic design will be interviewed to try and comprehend how they refuse to complicate a message or incite confusion. What is the effect and meaning of objectivity (and subjectivity) within the realm of visual communication?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
